Hello!
=====================
Welcome to my GitHub page. In November 2023 I graduated from Boise CodeWorks and am continuing to explore software development.
## Checkpoints

All the checkpoint projects are assignments from the BCW bootcamp. All received passing grades and represent the skills introduced during the previous week.

Keepr, a Pinterest-style application, was our full stack final.

## Capstone

The Geo-Stache capstone application was designed alongside Axel Arciniega, Sam Luna, Tiffany Hays, and Tyler Higby. It incorprates Google Map's API to allow users to play cache games.
